Some illustrative examples created to support the lectures 
"Studying rare events in molecular dynamics simulations: from free energies to mechanistic insights" 
at the 2021 *Han-sur-Lesse Winterschool in Theoretical Chemistry and Spectroscopy.*

All examples are simulations conducted with PLUMED + CP2K/LAMMPS. Input files necessary to
reproduce them are provided. Useful outputs for instant analysis are readily available.
The most important points of interest and analysis are contained within the 
<code>analysis.ipynb</code> Jupyter notebooks in each directory.

Usually, the notebooks should render directly inside the GitHub web interface, but its
performance seems flaky at best. So, alternatively, you can use the 
[nbviewer service](https://nbviewer.org/github/kbal/winterschool2021/tree/master/).
